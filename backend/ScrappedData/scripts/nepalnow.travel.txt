Nepal Tourism Board – Festive Greetings & Updates
Nepal Tourism Board – Festive Greetings & Updates
October 10, 2024
Status
Dear Esteemed Travelers and Travel Enablers,
As we approach the vibrant festive season of Dashain, Dipawali, Nepal Sambat, and Chhath, I extend warm greetings to you all from the heart of Nepal. This time of year brings an abundance of joy, celebrations, and reflection to our communities and to all seeking to explore our beautiful country.
Post-monsoon, Nepal’s landscape has transformed into a colorful canvas with crystal-clear skies, majestic snowy mountains, and lush green forests. Our natural beauty is more captivating than ever. You will encounter smiling faces and the warmth of our rich ancient culture as our diverse communities come alive with numerous feasts and festivals.
While recent heavy rains caused disruptions to a few highways, I am happy to report that the government has promptly responded to restore functionality. These routes are vital not only for tourism but also as lifelines for local communities. All airports are fully operational, and all destinations and trekking trails remain intact.
To facilitate travellers in obtaining authentic information in real-time, we have developed a portal,
nepalnow.travel
, where travelers, guides, and locals can easily update the situation on the roads and trekking trails. Additionally, the
Nepal Tourism Board
Crisis Cell, in close coordination with the Tourist Police, is available 24/7. We are fully committed to ensuring safer and accessible travel for all.
I warmly invite you to visit, experience, and enjoy the wonders and diversity of Nepal. Embrace our culture, immerse yourself in amazing adventures, revel in our festivals, and explore the breathtaking landscapes that await you. Your visit to Nepal will certainly enrich your journey.
We look forward to welcoming you to Nepal for a memorable lifetime experience!
Warm regards,
Deepak Raj Joshi
CEO, Nepal Tourism Board

Should I cancel my trip to Nepal?
Should I cancel my trip to Nepal?
October 1, 2024
Status
The short answer? No. There is no need to cancel your trip to Nepal. In fact, this is the moment when Nepal might need your presence the most.
Traveling to Nepal, even in the wake of disasters like severe flooding and landslides, offers unique opportunities to contribute to the country’s recovery while still enjoying a rewarding and meaningful experience. Here’s why:
Support Local Communities
: Tourism is a vital part of Nepal’s economy, especially in rural areas where communities rely heavily on travelers for income. Your visit provides direct financial support to local businesses, guides, and artisans, helping them recover faster.
Resilient Infrastructure
: Nepal has a strong track record of quickly restoring road and trail lifelines after natural disasters. The country’s ability to rebuild and ensure safe travel routes means that key trekking paths and tourism destinations are accessible again within a short period, allowing you to continue your adventure while supporting recovery efforts.
Responsible Travel
: Choosing to visit during challenging times demonstrates responsible and ethical travel. It sends a message of solidarity with the Nepali people and reinforces the importance of sustainable tourism. Travelers can engage in ways that benefit the environment and the communities working hard to restore normalcy.
Unique Experience
: Seeing Nepal during its recovery phase offers a more intimate look at the country’s resilience and the determination of its people. You’ll witness the beauty of Nepal not just in its landscapes but in its spirit and the strength of its communities, making your trip even more meaningful.
Helping Hands
: By choosing to come, you are essentially participating in the revival of one of the world’s most beautiful trekking and cultural destinations. Your presence plays a role in ensuring that Nepal’s natural wonders, cultural heritage, and iconic trails continue to thrive for future generations of travelers.
Traveling to Nepal in such times shows a commitment to its people and nature, making a positive difference in their recovery efforts.
What is happening?
Heavy rains at the tail end of the Monsoon in September 24 has caused damage to property and infrastructure and resulted in loss of life.
While relief works are underway, the tourism industry is working fast to get all access, trails and attractions back on track.

Whats the condition of Trekking Trails?
Whats the condition of Trekking Trails?
October 1, 2024
Status
Most trekking trails in the country are fine. We had a massive dump of snow in the higher areas, and locals are already working to open up routes around Cho La in the Everest Region, for example. Also remember that the flooding and landslides did not affect the Annapurnas as much, and west. It only affected the midhills and not even the Everest Region, except for the snow dump.

Important to know that the whole country was not affected by the flooding and landslides. The huge rain dump was only in the areas around Kathmandu and east of Kathmandu right upto the Indian Border.
Geopolitically, this means that from Kathmandu Valley and surrounds right upto the Indian Border were the only ones in the country that had the most damage.
Most of the flooding and landslides happened in the midhills and not in the high himalayas.

Nepal is a very resilient country. We tend to get citizen groups together very fast in the beginning, helping out in any ways we can. Post that the bigger machinery of the government and development partners kick in to help the people in need.
Natural disasters are not new in Nepal, and while we are not always prepared, response is quite fast.
Most of the roads that have been damaged are being repaired and made passable at record speed. Why? This is not nescessarily for tourism. We need it. This is the Festival Season in Nepal and everyone needs to go back home in a few weeks. The roads are essential for that.

Is Nepal expecting more rain?
Is Nepal expecting more rain?
October 6, 2024

Not any more. Post the heavy rains that caused the flooding, there was a little scare as another formation brought in clouds and rain from the Eastern side. That turned out to be not so bad.
That’s all gone away now, and we have beautiful Fall weather – crisp in the mornings and evenings, and warm and sometimes even hot in the day time!
TOP TIP:
The temperature differential in Nepal is huge, so its all about layers here, that you can peel off as it gets hotter and layer on as it get cooler. Pack that way, and it will work really well!
For more detailed weather reports, consult popular weather apps, some are listed on this site!
