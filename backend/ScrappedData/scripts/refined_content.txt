NepalNow, an initiative of the Nepal Tourism Board, provides news, stories, and updates on the status of Nepal, particularly for tourists.  Following heavy rains and flooding in September 2024, which caused damage and loss of life, Nepal is recovering.  While relief work continues, the tourism industry is working to restore trails, attractions, and accessibility.  An online, regularly updated interactive map details the current status of affected areas.

For weather information, NepalNow recommends the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) for official forecasts, Mountain-Forecast for trekking/climbing conditions, and AccuWeather for general forecasts. Highway updates are available on the Situation Summary page and via local hotlines: 1149, 103, and 100.  Travelers are advised to call these numbers before their trips.

Despite the previous challenges, Nepal is experiencing clear skies and beautiful vistas.  The CEO of the Nepal Tourism Board, Deepak R Joshi, has issued a festive greeting and update, reassuring tourists that Nepal is open for business.  A dedicated community of tourism professionals and stakeholders maintains these updates.

The site addresses frequently asked questions, emphasizing that trips to Nepal need not be canceled.  In fact, the country may benefit from tourism now more than ever.  Most trekking trails are reported as fine, with the primary impact of the flooding and landslides concentrated around the Kathmandu Valley and eastward to the Indian border.  Nepal is described as resilient and actively coping with the disaster.  The heavy rains have subsided, and no further significant rainfall is expected.
