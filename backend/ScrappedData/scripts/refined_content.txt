Nepal is open for tourism and welcoming visitors for the festive season (Dashain, Dipawali, Nepal Sambat, and Chhath).  The post-monsoon season offers stunning landscapes with clear skies, snow-capped mountains, and lush greenery. While recent heavy rains caused some highway disruptions, the government has been working swiftly to restore access. These routes are crucial for both tourism and local communities.  All airports are fully operational, and all trekking trails and destinations remain intact.

To provide travelers with real-time information, Nepal has launched a portal, nepalnow.travel, where travelers, guides, and locals can share updates on road and trail conditions.  The Nepal Tourism Board Crisis Cell, working with the Tourist Police, is available 24/7 to ensure safe and accessible travel.

The areas most affected by the flooding and landslides were around Kathmandu and east towards the Indian border, primarily in the mid-hills, not the high Himalayas. The Annapurna region and areas to the west were less impacted.  Heavy snow in higher elevations, like the Everest region around Cho La, is being addressed by local communities working to reopen routes.  Most trekking trails remain in good condition.

Nepal is recovering quickly thanks to citizen groups and government/development partner efforts. Road repairs are being prioritized for the festival season to allow people to travel home.  The country is resilient and experienced in responding to natural disasters.  While not always fully prepared, response is generally rapid.  The website encourages visitors to check the status map for regular updates on trekking trail conditions.
